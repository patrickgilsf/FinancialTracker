# Contributing

All contributions are welcome! The purpose of this library is to keep function parity with the Alpha Vantage API, while keeping a slim and intuitive programming interface. Before any pull requests are made, please run `npm run lint` to fix style issues and ensure that all test are passing `npm test`. New pull requests should contain, or fix, tests to ensure the code coverage is not reduced. If you need help, feel free to tag me in the pull request comments!

The build script, `npm run build`, can be used to rebuild the UMD module `dist/bundle.js` and it should be updated with each pull request.
